## Software design

### Error handling

#### What does 'fail fast' mean in terms of exception handling? Why is it a good practice?

The fail fast principle stands for stopping the current operation as soon as any unexpected operation occurs.
Adhering to this principle generally results in a more stable solution.

##### Why Fail-Fast?

Fail-fast makes bugs and failures appear sooner, thus:

+ Bugs are earlier to detect, easier to reproduce and faster to fix.

+ It's faster to stabilize softwares.

+ Fewer bugs and defects will go into prodduction, thus leading to higher-quality ad more production-ready software.

+ The cost of failures and bugs are reduced.
 
##### Application of Fail-Fast

Fail-fast is the principle behind many Agile practices:

+ Test-driven development: Writing tests to cover all the cases in which it would fail and all the requirements
it has to meet, before even implementing it.

+ Continuous integration: An agile practice in software development, where developers are required to
integrate their current works into shared repository/branch several times a day. Each integration is
verified by automated builds, thus helping team to find and fix problems early.


## Computer Science

### Data structures

#### How to find the middle element of singly linked list in O(n)?
#### Given an array of integers going from 1 to 100 (both inclusive) there is a duplicated entry. How to find it?
#### What is a linked list? How to find if a linked list has a loop?
#### What is the Big O time complexity of the common operations in an ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap? And of a bubble sort, quicksort, finding items in a Binary Search tree?
#### How does HashMap work?
#### Why is it important for keys in a map to have an immutable type? (Consider String for example.)

String, Integer and other wrapper classes are natural candidates for HashMap key. String is most frequently used key
because String is immutable, final and overrides equals() and hashCode() methods. Other wrapper classes also
share similar properties. 

Immutability is required in order to prevent changes on fields used to calculate hashCode because
if the key object returns different hashCode during insertion and retrieval, then it won't be possible to get the object from the HashMap.
Immutability is required as it offers other advantages, like thread-safety; if you can keep your hashCode the same
by only making certains fields final, then you go for that as well. Since equals() and hashCode() method are used during
retrieval of value object from HashMap, it's important that the key object correctly overrides these methods.

### Other

#### What is a garbage collector, in a nutshell?

**Garbage Collection** in Java is a process by which the programs perform memory management automatically.
The Garbage Collector(GC) finds the unused objects and deletes them to reclaim the memory. In Java, dynamic memory
allocation of objects is achieved using the new operator that uses some memory and the memory remains allocated until there
are references for the use of the object.

When there are no references to an object, it is assumed to be no longer needed, and the memory occupied by the
object can be reclaimed. There is no explicit need to destroy an object as Java handles the de-allocation automatically.

## Programming paradigms

### Procedural

#### What is casting? What is the difference between up vs downcasting?

Casting is taking and Object of one particular type and "turning it into" another Object type.
Up-casting is casting to a supertype, while downcasting is casting to a subtype. Upcasting and downcasting gives us
advantages, like Polymorphipsm or grouping by different objects. We can treat an object of a child class type to be as an object
of its parent class type. This is called upcasting. Now, anytime an object of parent class type is type cast into a child
class type, it is called downcast.


#### Which order should we catch the exceptions? Why?

When catching exceptions, you want to always catch the most specific first and then the most generic. If the first
catch matches the exception, it executes, if it doesn't, the next one is tried ad so on until one is matched or none are.
